# Bytesize URL
Bytesize URL is a web application that allows users to upload files and get a URL to share with others. The frontend is built with React and uses Vite as the development server, while the backend is built with Node.js and MongoDB, and uses Cloudinary for file storage.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies for the frontend by navigating to the frontend directory and running npm install.
3. Run the development server for the frontend by running npm run dev.

   For Backend:
5. Install dependencies for the backend by navigating to the backend branch and running npm install.
6. Replace the MongoDB connection URL in backend/.env with your own MongoDB URL.
7. Run the backend server by running npm run start.

# Usage
Once the frontend and backend are running, you can access the web application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. From there, you can upload files and get a URL to share with others.
